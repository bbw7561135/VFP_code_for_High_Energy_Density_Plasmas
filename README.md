Electron transport codes for High Energy Density Laboratory Plasmas

I developed the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck code OSHUN in 2008-2011 as a post-doc working with Tony Bell in Oxford. The code is described in detailed in our  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999111002828">2011 JCP paper</a>. I continued working on this code at UCLA until 2011 and a discussion of the updated version can be found in the <a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.4801750">2013 PoP paper</a>. A brief summary of the code can be found at <a href="https://picksc.idre.ucla.edu/software/software-production-codes/oshun/"> PICKSC</a>.

In this repository, under OSHUN-1 you can find the version of the code used for the latter of the two papers. 

Under OSHUN-2 you can find the new version I was working on in 2013. Work on this code has continued under PICKSC and a new 1D version of this code is freely available <a href="https://github.com/UCLA-Plasma-Simulation-Group/OSHUN"> here</a>.
